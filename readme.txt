Adds each post's embed code to the post edit screen for easy copying.

== Description ==

*Note that this plugin requires WordPress 4.4+. Right now, that means that you will need to be running the 4.4 beta release until the final version is officially released. You can run the latest beta using the [WordPress Beta Tester](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/) plugin.*

The oEmbed feature that is built into WordPress core from version 4.4 allows your content to be easily embedded in any other site. This is great if the site in which you are embedding your content supports oEmbed, but in many cases it does not. In these cases you will need to paste the full embed code on the site in question. This plugin provides that embed code for you right on the post edit screen.

**Features**

- Find your embed code right on the post edit screen
- Customise the width and height of the embed before copying the code

== Screenshots ==

1. The embed code meta box on the post edit screen.
2. The full post edit screen (so you can see the meta box in context).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The meta box is not showing for me - what gives? =

The embed code meta box will only show for posts that have a status of 'published' - it will not show for drafts or private posts as those cannot be embedded externally anyway.

= No really - the meta box is *still* not showing for me! =

That's not even a question, but the answer is most likely that you are using a WordPress version older than 4.4 - the oEmbed feature is only available in WordPress 4.4 and above, so you need to be more up to date in order to use this plugin.
